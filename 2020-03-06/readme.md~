## We had a remote visitor David Zhou give a talk about his work with UC Irvine group, on looking for doppler dipole from 3.4keV dark matter decay line, within Milky Way; his results are forecasts for a future x-ray mission.. 

## Analyzing Ly-a data to constrain nCDM

We started collaboratively coding to analyze the Lyman-alpha data from [Chabanier et al 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08103.pdf) (in data directory), in order to fit a "alpha, beta, gamma" model for non-cold dark matter, as presented in [Murgia et al 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08371).
