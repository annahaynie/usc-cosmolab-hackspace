# usc-cosmolab-hackspace

Materials from USC CosmoLab weekly meetings live here.

Meetings have roughly three parts: Hacks, News, and Physics. In Spring 2020, the focus is on Hacks, with the main objective to provide astro grads, undergrads, and postdocs with computer-based tools for research. The group's collaborative hack project this semester is analysis of Lyman-alpha data to produce constraints on dark matter interactions with protons.

Meeting policy: CosmoLab is a safe learning space for cosmologists at USC to ask questions and to collaboratively think about the big problems in physics. Competition and judgement should be left for other venues; curiosity, critical thinking, and collegiality are welcome.
